# Chef-Prime
A simple discord bot for playing youtube videos with support for slash commands, timestamps and playlists

## Usage:
1. Install required libraries with:
```
pip install -R requirements.txt
```
2. Edit .env with your bot's discord token
3. Launch either "main.py" or "main-rewrite.py"

## What's the difference between the rewrite and the other version?
The other version streams the music directly, while the rewrite downloads it, plays it then deletes it.
